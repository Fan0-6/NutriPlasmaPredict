# NutriPlasmaPredict: Nutritional Insights and Cancer Prevention Through Regression Analysis

Welcome to NutriPlasmaPredict, a pioneering research initiative dedicated to elucidating the complex relationships between dietary habits, personal characteristics, and the plasma concentrations of critical nutrients, Retinol and Beta-Carotene. Our study meticulously analyzes data from 315 patients who underwent surgical interventions for benign growths, aiming to uncover how lifestyle choices and dietary patterns influence the levels of these vitamins in the bloodstream and their potential links to cancer susceptibility.

Research has suggested that lower dietary or plasma levels of vital nutrients like retinol and beta-carotene may be associated with an increased risk of cancer. Through our rigorous regression analysis, the betaplasma and retplasma models reveal significant predictors affecting these nutrient levels. Fiber intake, dietary beta-carotene, and age are found to positively influence beta-carotene levels, whereas factors such as the Quetelet index and fat intake demonstrate negative correlations. Interestingly, our findings suggest that less frequent vitamin usage may be more beneficial than more frequent consumption. For retinol, sex, caloric intake, and age emerge as significant predictors, highlighting the role of individual traits over dietary patterns in determining retinol concentrations.

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers, healthcare professionals, and public health advocates, offering datasets, analytical code, and detailed documentation. By shedding light on the dietary and personal factors that impact Retinol and Beta-Carotene plasma concentrations, NutriPlasmaPredict contributes to the broader understanding of nutrition's role in cancer prevention and paves the way for informed dietary guidelines and health strategies.
