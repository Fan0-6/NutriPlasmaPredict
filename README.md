# NutriPlasmaPredict: Nutritional Insights and Cancer Prevention Through Regression Analysis

Welcome to NutriPlasmaPredict, a pioneering research initiative exploring the intricate links between dietary habits, personal characteristics, and the plasma concentrations of critical nutrients, notably Retinol and Beta-Carotene. Our work centers on analyzing data from 315 patients who underwent surgery for benign growths, with the aim of understanding how lifestyle choices and dietary patterns influence nutrient levels in the bloodstream and their potential connections to cancer risk.

## Project Overview

NutriPlasmaPredict delves into the complex relationships between diet, individual traits, and nutrient plasma levels, focusing on Retinol and Beta-Carotene. Our research is driven by the hypothesis that lower dietary or plasma levels of these essential nutrients may correlate with a higher cancer risk. Through detailed regression analyses, we aim to identify significant predictors that affect the concentrations of these vitamins, thereby contributing to the field of cancer prevention research.

## Research Findings

Our analysis has led to intriguing insights into the factors influencing the plasma levels of Retinol and Beta-Carotene:

- **Beta-Carotene:** Fiber intake, dietary beta-carotene, and age positively affect beta-carotene levels in the plasma. Conversely, the Quetelet index (a measure of body fat) and fat intake show negative correlations. Notably, our data suggest that less frequent vitamin usage could be more advantageous than more frequent consumption in maintaining healthy beta-carotene levels.
- **Retinol:** Sex, caloric intake, and age are identified as significant predictors for retinol concentrations, underscoring the importance of individual characteristics over dietary patterns.

## Repository Contents

- **Analytical Code:** R and Python scripts used for performing the regression analyses, allowing for reproducibility and further exploration.
- **Documentation:** Detailed explanation of the research methodology, findings, and their implications for dietary guidelines and cancer prevention strategies.

## Goal

Our goal is to provide a robust foundation for future research and practical applications in nutrition and public health. By highlighting the dietary and personal factors impacting Retinol and Beta-Carotene levels, NutriPlasmaPredict aims to contribute significantly to the understanding of nutrition's role in cancer prevention and to support the development of informed health recommendations.
